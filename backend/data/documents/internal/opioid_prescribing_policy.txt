DOCUMENT: SafeRx Opioid Prescribing Policy
Type: Clinical Policy Document
Effective Date: March 1, 2024
Last Updated: February 15, 2024
Department: Pain Management Committee

============================================================

PURPOSE
-------

This policy establishes guidelines for safe and appropriate opioid prescribing to minimize risk of addiction, overdose, and diversion while ensuring adequate pain management for patients with legitimate medical needs.

SCOPE
-----

This policy applies to all healthcare providers with prescriptive authority within the SafeRx network, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.

RISK ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------

Before initiating opioid therapy, prescribers must:

1. Complete validated risk assessment tool (ORT, SOAPP-R, or equivalent)
2. Review Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data
3. Document pain diagnosis with objective findings when possible
4. Establish functional goals for treatment
5. Obtain informed consent documenting risks and alternatives

High-Risk Indicators:
- History of substance use disorder
- Concurrent benzodiazepine or CNS depressant use
- History of overdose
- Psychiatric comorbidities
- Age <30 with chronic non-cancer pain
- Request for specific opioid by name

PRESCRIBING LIMITS
------------------

Acute Pain (injury, post-surgical):
- Maximum 3-day supply for opioid-naive patients
- Maximum 7-day supply for post-surgical (with documented justification)
- No refills on initial prescription

Chronic Non-Cancer Pain:
- Start with lowest effective dose
- Avoid exceeding 50 MME/day without documented justification
- Prescriptions >90 MME/day require pain specialist consultation
- Re-evaluation required every 3 months

Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) Reference:
- Hydrocodone 10mg = 10 MME
- Oxycodone 10mg = 15 MME
- Morphine 10mg = 10 MME
- Fentanyl patch 25mcg/hr = 60 MME
- Tramadol 100mg = 10 MME

PROHIBITED PRACTICES
--------------------

The following are strictly prohibited:

1. Prescribing opioids to patients with active substance use disorder (except for OUD treatment)
2. Co-prescribing opioids with benzodiazepines (without documented justification and increased monitoring)
3. Prescribing opioids based solely on patient self-reported pain without examination
4. Refilling prescriptions early without documented clinical need
5. Prescribing more than 7-day supply of immediate-release opioids for acute pain

NALOXONE CO-PRESCRIBING
-----------------------

Naloxone must be co-prescribed for patients meeting any of the following criteria:
- Opioid dosage ≥50 MME/day
- Concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions
- History of overdose
- History of substance use disorder
- Patient request

Preferred naloxone products:
- Narcan nasal spray 4mg (Tier 2)
- Generic naloxone injection kit (Tier 1)

MONITORING REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

Ongoing monitoring for patients on chronic opioid therapy:

1. PDMP Review: At initiation and every prescription thereafter
2. Urine Drug Screening: Baseline and at least annually (more frequent if high-risk)
3. Functional Assessment: Document pain levels and functional status at each visit
4. Pill Counts: Random pill counts for high-risk patients
5. Treatment Agreement: Signed agreement renewed annually

TAPERING AND DISCONTINUATION
----------------------------

Consider tapering when:
- Patient requests dose reduction
- Pain resolves or significantly improves
- Patient experiences side effects
- Evidence of misuse or diversion
- Patient not meeting functional goals

Tapering Guidelines:
- Reduce dose by 10-25% every 2-4 weeks for gradual taper
- Slower taper (10% per month) for long-term therapy (>1 year)
- Never abruptly discontinue; risk of withdrawal and uncontrolled pain
- Refer to addiction medicine if substance use disorder suspected

DRUG INTERACTIONS - CRITICAL WARNINGS
-------------------------------------

AVOID concurrent use with:
- Benzodiazepines (alprazolam, lorazepam, diazepam): Increased risk of fatal respiratory depression
- Muscle relaxants (carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine): Additive CNS depression
- Gabapentin/pregabalin at high doses: Increased respiratory depression risk
- Alcohol: Severe CNS depression
- MAO inhibitors: Serotonin syndrome with meperidine, tramadol

USE WITH CAUTION with:
- Antihistamines: Additive sedation
- Antipsychotics: Increased sedation and respiratory depression
- SSRIs/SNRIs: Serotonin syndrome risk (especially with tramadol)

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------

Every opioid prescription must include documentation of:
1. Pain diagnosis (ICD-10 code)
2. Pain score and functional assessment
3. PDMP review date
4. Risk-benefit discussion
5. Treatment goals
6. Alternative treatments considered

COMPLIANCE AND CONSEQUENCES
---------------------------

Failure to comply with this policy may result in:
- Mandatory additional training
- Prescriptive authority review
- Referral to credentialing committee
- Reporting to state medical board (severe violations)
