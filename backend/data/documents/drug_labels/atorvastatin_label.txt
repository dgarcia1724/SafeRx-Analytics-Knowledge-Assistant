In the atorvastatin calcium placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 atorvastatin calcium vs. 7311 placebo; age range 10 to 93 years, 39% women, 91% White, 3% Black, 2% Asian, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, the most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium (n=8755), from seventeen placebo-controlled trials. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 2% in Patients Atorvastatin Calcium- Treated with any Dose and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction % Placebo N=7311 % 10 mg N=3908 % 20 mg N=188 % 40 mg N=604 % 80 mg N=4055 % Any dose N=8755 Nasopharyngitis 8.2 12.9 5.3 7.0 4.2 8.3 Arthralgia 6.5 8.9 11.7 10.6 4.3 6.9 Diarrhea 6.3 7.3 6.4 14.1 5.2 6.8 Pain in extremity 5.9 8.5 3.7 9.3 3.1 6.0 Urinary tract infection 5.6 6.9 6.4 8.0 4.1 5.7 Dyspepsia 4.3 5.9 3.2 6.0 3.3 4.7 Nausea 3.5 3.7 3.7 7.1 3.8 4.0 Musculoskeletal pain 3.6 5.2 3.2 5.1 2.3 3.8 Muscle spasms 3.0 4.6 4.8 5.1 2.4 3.6 Myalgia 3.1 3.6 5.9 8.4 2.7 3.5 Insomnia 2.9 2.8 1.1 5.3 2.8 3.0 Pharyngolaryngeal pain 2.1 3.9 1.6 2.8 0.7 2.3 Other adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Body as a whole: malaise, pyrexia Digestive system: abdominal discomfort, eructation, flatulence, hepatitis, cholestasis Musculoskeletal system: musculoskeletal pain, muscle fatigue, neck pain, joint swelling Metabolic and nutritional system: transaminases increase, liver function test abnormal, blood alkaline phosphatase increase, creatine phosphokinase increase, hyperglycemia Nervous system: nightmare Respiratory system: epistaxis Skin and appendages: urticaria Special senses: vision blurred, tinnitus Urogenital system: white blood cells urine positive Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests Persistent elevations in serum transaminases, defined as more than 3 times the ULN and occurring on 2 or more occasions, occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver enzyme tests in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent liver enzyme elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin calcium. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT, [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] 10,001 patients (age range 29 to 78 years, 19% women; 94% White, 3% Black, 1% Asian, 2% other) with clinically evident CHD were treated with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg daily (n=5006) or atorvastatin calcium 80 mg daily (n=4995). In the high-dose atorvastatin calcium group, there were more patients with serious adverse reactions (1.8%) and discontinuations due to adverse reactions (9.9%) as compared to the low-dose group (1.4%; 8.1%, respectively) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (≥3 x ULN twice within 4 to10 days) occurred in 1.3% of individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in 0.2% of individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK (≥ 10 x ULN) were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin group (0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (0.1%). Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL, 4731 subjects (age range 21 to 92 years, 40% women; 93% White, 3% Black, 1% Asian, 3% other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months were treated with atorvastatin calcium 80 mg (n=2365) or placebo (n=2366) for a median follow-up of 4.9 years. There was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations (≥ 3 x ULN twice within 4 to 10 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.1%). Elevations of CK (>10 x ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 6.1% of subjects in the atorvastatin group and 3.8% of subjects in the placebo group. In a post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin calcium 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (9.2% vs. 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (2.3% vs. 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin calcium vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Patients who entered the trial with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (16% atorvastatin calcium vs. 4% placebo). Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies of Atorvastatin Calcium in Pediatric Patients with HeFH In a 26-week controlled study in pediatric patients with HeFH (ages 10 years to 17 years) (n=140, 31% female; 92% White, 1.6% Blacks, 1.6% Asians, 4.8% other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin calcium 10 to 20 mg daily, as an adjunct to diet to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels, was generally similar to that of placebo [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atorvastatin calcium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: pancreatitis General disorders: fatigue Hepatobiliary Disorders: fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Immune system disorders : anaphylaxis Injury: tendon rupture Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: rhabdomyolysis, myositis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use. Nervous system disorders: dizziness, peripheral neuropathy. There have been rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins. Cognitive impairment was generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). Psychiatric disorders: depression Respiratory disorders: interstitial lung disease Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis)


DRUG INTERACTIONS
-----------------

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for details regarding concomitant use of atorvastatin calcium with other drugs or grapefruit juice that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis ( 2.5 , 7.1 ). Rifampin: May reduce atorvastatin plasma concentrations. Administer simultaneously with atorvastatin calcium ( 7.2 ). Oral Contraceptives: May increase plasma levels of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol; consider this effect when selecting an oral contraceptive (7.3 ). Digoxin: May increase digoxin plasma levels; monitor patients appropriately ( 7.3 ). 7.1 Drug Interactions that may Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Atorvastatin Calcium Atorvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp, or BCRP). Atorvastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP3A4 and transporters. Table 2 includes a list of drugs that may increase exposure to atorvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly and instructions for preventing or managing them [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 2: Drug Interactions that may Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Atorvastatin Cyclosporine or Gemfibrozil Clinical Impact: Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin and cyclosporine, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Gemfibrozil may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with atorvastatin. Intervention: Concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with atorvastatin is not recommended. Anti-Viral Medications Clinical Impact: Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin with many anti-viral medications, which are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or transporters (e.g., BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp, MRP2, and/or OAT2) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir with atorvastatin. Intervention: Concomitant use of tipranavir plus ritonavir or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with atorvastatin is not recommended. In patients taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, or simeprevir, consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use with atorvastatin. In patients taking saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, elbasvir plus grazoprevir or letermovir, do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg. In patients taking nelfinavir, do not exceed atorvastatin 40 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir with atorvastatin. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Examples: Tipranavir plus ritonavir, glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, simeprevir, saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, elbasvir plus grazoprevir, letermovir, nelfinavir, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir. Select Azole Antifungals or Macrolide Antibiotics Clinical Impact: Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin with select azole antifungals or macrolide antibiotics, due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and/or transporters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: In patients taking clarithromycin or itraconazole, do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of other azole antifungals or macrolide antibiotics with atorvastatin. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Examples: Erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. Niacin Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been observed with concomitant use of lipid modifying dosages of niacin ( > 1 gram/day niacin) with atorvastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using lipid modifying dosages of niacin concomitantly with atorvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Fibrates (other than Gemfibrozil) Clinical Impact: Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with atorvastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with atorvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Colchicine Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with atorvastatin. Intervention: Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of colchicine with atorvastatin. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Grapefruit Juice Clinical Impact: Grapefruit juice consumption, especially excessive consumption, more than 1.2 liters/daily, can raise the plasma levels of atorvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Intervention: Avoid intake of large quantities of grapefruit juice, more than 1.2 liters daily, when taking atorvastatin. 7.2 Drug Interactions that may Decrease Exposure to Atorvastatin Calcium Table 3 presents drug interactions that may decrease exposure to atorvastatin and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 3: Drug Interactions that may Decrease Exposure to Atorvastatin Rifampin Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with rifampin, an inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 and inhibitor of OATP1B1, can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations. Intervention: Administer atorvastatin and rifampin simultaneously. 7.3 Atorvastatin Calcium Effects on Other Drugs Table 4 presents Atorvastatin’s effect on other drugs and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 4: Atorvastatin Effects on Other Drugs Oral Contraceptives Clinical Impact: Co-administration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Consider this when selecting an oral contraceptive for patients taking atorvastatin. Digoxin Clinical Impact: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were co-administered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Monitor patients taking digoxin appropriately.


USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
---------------------------

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ). Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended during treatment with atorvastatin calcium ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue atorvastatin when pregnancy is recognized. Alternatively, consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. atorvastatin decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, atorvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients. Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with atorvastatin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data) . In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered atorvastatin at doses that resulted in up to 30 and 20 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). In rats administered atorvastatin during gestation and lactation, decreased postnatal growth and development delay were observed at doses ≥ 6 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential confounders – including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use – using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly pre-existing diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data Atorvastatin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure at the MRHD based on surface area (mg/m 2 ). In rats, the maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg resulted in increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weight. At the maternally toxic doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits, there was increased post-implantation loss, and at 100 mg/kg/day fetal body weights were decreased. In a study in pregnant rats administered 20, 100, or 225 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 20 (weaning), there was decreased survival at birth, postnatal day 4, weaning, and post-weaning in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mg/kg/day, a dose at which maternal toxicity was observed. Pup body weight was decreased through postnatal day 21 at 100 mg/kg/day, and through postnatal day 91 at 225 mg/kg/day. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mg/kg/day and acoustic startle at 225 mg/kg/day; pinnae detachment and eye-opening at 225 mg/kg/day). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mg/kg) and 22 times (225 mg/kg) the human exposure at the MRHD, based on AUC. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information about the presence of atorvastatin in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. However, it has been shown that another drug in this class passes into human milk. Studies in rats have shown that atorvastatin and/or its metabolites are present in the breast milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk (see Data). Statins, including atorvastatin, decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, based on the mechanism of action, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with atorvastatin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Data Following a single oral administration of 10 mg/kg of radioactive atorvastatin to lactating rats, the concentration of total radioactivity was determined. Atorvastatin and/or its metabolites were measured in the breast milk and pup plasma at a 2:1 ratio (milk:plasma). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C have been established pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. Use of atorvastatin calcium for this indication is based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 187 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. In this limited controlled trial, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the boys or girls, or on menstrual cycle length in girls. The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium as an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies to reduce LDL-C have been established pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HoFH. Use of atorvastatin calcium for this indication is based on a trial without a concurrent control group in 8 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HoFH [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or HoFH, or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH or HoFH). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of atorvastatin calcium -treated patients in clinical trials, 15,813 (40%) were ≥65 years old and 2,800 (7%) were ≥75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Advanced age (≥65 years) is a risk factor for atorvastatin calcium -associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving atorvastatin calcium for the increased risk of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Monitor all patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy. Renal impairment does not affect the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin calcium, therefore there is no dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin calcium are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4-fold greater in patients with Childs-Pugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16-fold and 11-fold increased, respectively, in patients with Childs-Pugh B disease. atorvastatin calcium is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4) ].

There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data Atorvastatin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure at the MRHD based on surface area (mg/m 2 ). In rats, the maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg resulted in increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weight. At the maternally toxic doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits, there was increased post-implantation loss, and at 100 mg/kg/day fetal body weights were decreased. In a study in pregnant rats administered 20, 100, or 225 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 20 (weaning), there was decreased survival at birth, postnatal day 4, weaning, and post-weaning in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mg/kg/day, a dose at which maternal toxicity was observed. Pup body weight was decreased through postnatal day 21 at 100 mg/kg/day, and through postnatal day 91 at 225 mg/kg/day. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mg/kg/day and acoustic startle at 225 mg/kg/day; pinnae detachment and eye-opening at 225 mg/kg/day). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mg/kg) and 22 times (225 mg/kg) the human exposure at the MRHD, based on AUC. Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma.


PEDIATRIC USE
-------------

8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C have been established pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. Use of atorvastatin calcium for this indication is based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 187 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH. In this limited controlled trial, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the boys or girls, or on menstrual cycle length in girls. The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium as an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies to reduce LDL-C have been established pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HoFH. Use of atorvastatin calcium for this indication is based on a trial without a concurrent control group in 8 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HoFH [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin calcium have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or HoFH, or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH or HoFH).


GERIATRIC USE
-------------

8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of atorvastatin calcium -treated patients in clinical trials, 15,813 (40%) were ≥65 years old and 2,800 (7%) were ≥75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Advanced age (≥65 years) is a risk factor for atorvastatin calcium -associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving atorvastatin calcium for the increased risk of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].


OVERDOSAGE
----------

10 OVERDOSAGE No specific antidotes for atorvastatin are known. Contact Poison Control (1-800-222-1222) for latest recommendations. Due to extensive drug binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

11 DESCRIPTION Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Atorvastatin calcium USP is (βR, δR)-2-(p-fluorophenyl)-β,δ-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4(phenylcarbamoyl)pyrrole-l-heptanaote (1:2), trihydrate. The molecular formula of atorvastatin calcium USP is C 66 H 68 CaF 2 N 4 O 10 .3H 2 O and its molecular weight is 1209.41. Its structural formula is: Atorvastatin calcium USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium USP is soluble to freely soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in alcohol, insoluble to very slightly soluble in distilled water, in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and in acetonitrile. Atorvastatin calcium tablets, USP for oral use contain atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg (equivalent to 10.34 mg, 20.68 mg, 41.36 mg, or 82.73 mg atorvastatin calcium anhydrous) and the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, magnesium aluminometasilicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polysorbate 80, precipitated calcium carbonate, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, talc, polyethylene glycol and lecithin.


CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
---------------------

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-­methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. In animal models, atorvastatin calcium lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin calcium also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atorvastatin, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDL-C reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25% and 9%, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDL-C reduction is similar whether atorvastatin is given with or without food. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration . Distribution Mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is ≥98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Elimination Metabolism Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration. Specific Populations Geriatric Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age ≥65 years) than in young adults. Pediatric Apparent oral clearance of atorvastatin in pediatric subjects appeared similar to that of adults when scaled allometrically by body weight as the body weight was the only significant covariate in atorvastatin population PK model with data including pediatric HeFH patients (ages 10 years to 17 years of age, n=29) in an open-label, 8-week study. Gender Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in women differ from those in men (approximately 20% higher for Cmax and 10% lower for AUC); however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with atorvastatin between men and women. Renal Impairment Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. While studies have not been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of atorvastatin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4-fold greater in patients with Childs-Pugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16-fold and 11-fold increased, respectively, in patients with Childs-Pugh B disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interactions Atorvastatin is a substrate of the hepatic transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter. Metabolites of atorvastatin are substrates of OATP1B1. Atorvastatin is also identified as a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP, which may limit the intestinal absorption and biliary clearance of atorvastatin.
