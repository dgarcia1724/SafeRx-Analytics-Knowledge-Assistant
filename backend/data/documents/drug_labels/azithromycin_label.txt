INDICATIONS AND USAGE
---------------------

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications. [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for mild to moderate infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria: • Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Acute bacterial sinusitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in adults ( 1.1 ) • Urethritis and cervicitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Genital ulcer disease in men ( 1.1 ) • Acute otitis media in pediatric patients (6 months of age and older) ( 1.2 ) • Community-acquired pneumonia in adults and pediatric patients (6 months of age and older) ( 1.1 , 1.2 ) • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) ( 1.1 , 1.2 ) Limitation of Use: Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors. ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Adult Patients • Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae . • Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis. or Streptococcus pneumoniae . • Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy. • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy. • Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pyogenes , or Streptococcus agalactiae . • Urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae . • Genital ulcer disease in men due to Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid). Due to the small number of women included in clinical trials, the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of chancroid in women has not been established. 1.2 Pediatric Patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] • Acute otitis media (>6 months of age) caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae. • Community-acquired pneumonia (>6 months of age) due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae , or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy. • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis (>2 years of age) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy. 1.3 Limitations of Use Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following: • patients with cystic fibrosis, • patients with nosocomial infections, • patients with known or suspected bacteremia, • patients requiring hospitalization, • elderly or debilitated patients, or • patients with significant underlying health problems that may compromise their ability to respond to their illness (including immunodeficiency or functional asplenia). 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
-----------------

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: • Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • QT Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Cardiovascular Death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Most common adverse reactions are diarrhea (5 to 14%), nausea (3 to 18%), abdominal pain (3 to 7%), or vomiting (2 to 7%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Potentially serious adverse reactions of angioedema and cholestatic jaundice were reported. Approximately 0.7% of the patients (adults and pediatric patients) from the 5-day multiple-dose clinical trials discontinued azithromycin therapy because of treatment-related adverse reactions. In adults given 500 mg/day for 3 days, the discontinuation rate due to treatment-related adverse reactions was 0.6%. In clinical trials in pediatric patients given 30 mg/kg, either as a single dose or over 3 days, discontinuation from the trials due to treatment-related adverse reactions was approximately 1%. Most of the adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were related to the gastrointestinal tract, e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] Adults Multiple-dose regimens: Overall, the most common treatment-related adverse reactions in adult patients receiving multiple-dose regimens of azithromycin were related to the gastrointestinal system with diarrhea/loose stools (4 to 5%), nausea (3%), and abdominal pain (2 to 3%) being the most frequently reported. No other adverse reactions occurred in patients on the multiple-dose regimens of azithromycin with a frequency greater than 1%. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of 1% or less included the following: Cardiovascular: Palpitations, chest pain. Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting, melena, and cholestatic jaundice. Genitourinary: Monilia, vaginitis, and nephritis. Nervous System: Dizziness, headache, vertigo, and somnolence. General: Fatigue. Allergic: Rash, pruritus, photosensitivity, and angioedema. Single 1 gram dose regimen: Overall, the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving a single-dose regimen of 1 gram of azithromycin were related to the gastrointestinal system and were more frequently reported than in patients receiving the multiple-dose regimen. Adverse reactions that occurred in patients on the single 1 gram dosing regimen of azithromycin with a frequency of 1% or greater included diarrhea/loose stools (7%), nausea (5%), abdominal pain (5%), vomiting (2%), dyspepsia (1%), and vaginitis (1%). Single 2 gram dose regimen: Overall, the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving a single 2 gram dose of azithromycin were related to the gastrointestinal system. Adverse reactions that occurred in patients in this study with a frequency of 1% or greater included nausea (18%), diarrhea/loose stools (14%), vomiting (7%), abdominal pain (7%), vaginitis (2%), dyspepsia (1%), and dizziness (1%). The majority of these complaints were mild in nature. Pediatric Patients Single and Multiple-dose regimens: The types of adverse reactions in pediatric patients were comparable to those seen in adults, with different incidence rates for the dosage regimens recommended in pediatric patients. Acute Otitis Media: For the recommended total dosage regimen of 30 mg/kg, the most frequent adverse reactions (≥1%) attributed to treatment were diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, and rash. [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] The incidence, based on dosing regimen, is described in the table below: Dosage Regimen Diarrhea % Abdominal Pain % Vomiting % Nausea % Rash % 1-day 4.3% 1.4% 4.9% 1.0% 1.0% 3-day 2.6% 1.7% 2.3% 0.4% 0.6% 5-day 1.8% 1.2% 1.1% 0.5% 0.4% Community-Acquired Pneumonia: For the recommended dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg on Days 2 to 5, the most frequent adverse reactions attributed to treatment were diarrhea/loose stools, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, and rash. The incidence is described in the table below: Dosage Regimen Diarrhea/Loose stools % Abdominal Pain % Vomiting % Nausea % Rash % 5-day 5.8% 1.9% 1.9% 1.9% 1.6% Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis: For the recommended dosage regimen of 12 mg/kg on Days 1 to 5, the most frequent adverse reactions attributed to treatment were diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, and headache. The incidence is described in the table below: Dosage Regimen Diarrhea % Abdominal Pain % Vomiting % Nausea % Rash % Headache % 5-day 5.4% 3.4% 5.6% 1.8% 0.7% 1.1% With any of the treatment regimens, no other adverse reactions occurred in pediatric patients treated with azithromycin with a frequency greater than 1%. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of 1% or less included the following: Cardiovascular: Chest pain. Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia, constipation, anorexia, enteritis, flatulence, gastritis, jaundice, loose stools, and oral moniliasis. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Anemia and leukopenia. Nervous System: Headache (otitis media dosage), hyperkinesia, dizziness, agitation, nervousness, and insomnia. General: Fever, face edema, fatigue, fungal infection, malaise, and pain. Allergic: Rash and allergic reaction. Respiratory: Cough, pharyngitis, pleural effusion, and rhinitis. Skin and Appendages: Eczema, fungal dermatitis, pruritus, sweating, urticaria, and vesiculobullous rash. Special Senses: Conjunctivitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of azithromycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported with azithromycin during the postmarketing period in adult and/or pediatric patients for which a causal relationship may not be established include: Allergic: Arthralgia, edema, urticaria, and angioedema. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and hypotension. There have been reports of QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and cardiovascular death. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting/diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, oral candidiasis, pyloric stenosis, and reports of tongue discoloration. General: Asthenia, paresthesia, fatigue, malaise, and anaphylaxis. Genitourinary: Interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure and vaginitis. Hematopoietic: Thrombocytopenia. Liver/Biliary: Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Nervous System: Convulsions, dizziness/vertigo, headache, somnolence, hyperactivity, nervousness, agitation, and syncope. Psychiatric: Aggressive reaction and anxiety. Skin/Appendages: Pruritus, serious skin reactions including erythema multiforme, AGEP, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS. Special Senses: Hearing disturbances including hearing loss, deafness and/or tinnitus, and reports of taste/smell perversion and/or loss. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities Adults: Clinically significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows: with an incidence of greater than 1%: decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and blood glucose; elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, potassium, ALT, GGT, AST, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, platelet count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils; with an incidence of less than 1%: leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased sodium, potassium, platelet count, elevated monocytes, basophils, bicarbonate, serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, LDH, and phosphate. The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline. When follow-up was provided, changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible. In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 5000 patients, four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality. Pediatric Patients: One, Three, and Five-Day Regimens Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 3 days), or two 5-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 5 days) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined, with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1 to 5%. Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial. In that trial, an absolute neutrophil count between 500 to 1500 cells/mm 3 was observed in 10/64 patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose, 9/62 patients receiving 30 mg/kg given over 3 days, and 8/63 comparator patients. No patient had an absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/mm 3 . In multiple-dose clinical trials involving approximately 4700 pediatric patients, no patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.


DRUG INTERACTIONS
-----------------

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Nelfinavir: Close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted. ( 7.1 ) • Warfarin: Use with azithromycin may increase coagulation times; monitor prothrombin time. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Nelfinavir Co-administration of nelfinavir at steady-state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations. Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted. [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] 7.2 Warfarin Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly. 7.3 Potential Drug-Drug Interaction with Macrolides Interactions with digoxin, colchicine or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin. No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction. However, drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin, colchicine or phenytoin are used with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised.


USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
---------------------------

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of patients under 6 months of age have not been established. ( 8.4 ) • Geriatric use: Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience over several decades with azithromycin use in pregnant women have not identified any drug-associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Developmental toxicity studies with azithromycin in rats, mice, and rabbits showed no drug-induced fetal malformations at doses up to 4, 2, and 2 times, respectively, an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area. Decreased viability and delayed development were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered azithromycin from day 6 of pregnancy through weaning at a dose equivalent to 4 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with azithromycin use in pregnant women. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications. Animal Data Azithromycin administered during the period of organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations in rats and mice at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (moderately maternally toxic). Based on body surface area, this dose is approximately 4 (rats) and 2 (mice) times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg. In rabbits administered azithromycin at oral doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day during organogenesis, reduced maternal body weight and food consumption were observed in all groups; no evidence of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed at these doses, the highest of which is estimated to be 2 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area. In a pre- and postnatal development study, azithromycin was administered orally to pregnant rats from day 6 of pregnancy until weaning at doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption and body weight gain; increased stress at parturition) was observed at the higher dose. Effects in the offspring were noted at 200 mg/kg/day during the postnatal development period (decreased viability, delayed developmental landmarks). These effects were not observed in a pre- and postnatal rat study when up to 200 mg/kg/day of azithromycin was given orally beginning on day 15 of pregnancy until weaning. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Azithromycin is present in human milk (see Data) . Non-serious adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants after maternal administration of azithromycin (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no available data on the effects of azithromycin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for azithromycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azithromycin or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Advise women to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea, vomiting, or rash. Data Azithromycin breastmilk concentrations were measured in 20 women after receiving a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin during labor. Breastmilk samples collected on days 3 and 6 postpartum as well as 2 and 4 weeks postpartum revealed the presence of azithromycin in breastmilk up to 4 weeks after dosing. In another study, a single dose of azithromycin 500 mg was administered intravenously to 8 women prior to incision for cesarean section. Breastmilk (colostrum) samples obtained between 12 and 48 hours after dosing revealed that azithromycin persisted in breastmilk up to 48 hours. 8.4 Pediatric Use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Indications and Usage (1.2) , and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established. Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients (6 months of age or greater) is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults. Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis under 2 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In multiple-dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin, 9% of patients were at least 65 years of age (458/4949) and 3% of patients (144/4949) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]

PEDIATRIC USE
-------------

8.4 Pediatric Use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Indications and Usage (1.2) , and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established. Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients (6 months of age or greater) is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults. Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis under 2 years of age have not been established.


GERIATRIC USE
-------------

8.5 Geriatric Use In multiple-dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin, 9% of patients were at least 65 years of age (458/4949) and 3% of patients (144/4949) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]


OVERDOSAGE
----------

10 OVERDOSAGE Adverse reactions experienced at higher than recommended doses were similar to those seen at normal doses particularly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures are indicated as required.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

11 DESCRIPTION Azithromycin tablets USP contain the active ingredient azithromycin, a macrolide antibacterial drug, for oral administration. Azithromycin has the chemical name (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R)-13-[(2,6-dideoxy-3-C-methyl-3-O-methyl-α-L-ribo-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-2-ethyl-3,4,10-trihydroxy-3,5,6,8,10,12,14-heptamethyl-11-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)-β-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopentadecan-15-one. Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring. Its molecular formula is C 38 H 72 N 2 O 12 , and its molecular weight is 749.00. Azithromycin has the following structural formula: Azithromycin, as the dihydrate, is a white or almost white powder with a molecular formula of C 38 H 72 N 2 O 12• 2H 2 O and a molecular weight of 785.0. Azithromycin is supplied as tablets containing azithromycin dihydrate USP equivalent to either 250 mg or 500 mg azithromycin and the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, pregelatinized starch (maize), magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide and triacetin.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
---------------------

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug. [see Microbiology (12.4) ] 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens ( S. pneumoniae and S. aureus ). The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin. Cardiac Electrophysiology QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg azithromycin, respectively. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of a single 500 mg dose (two 250 mg tablets) to 36 fasted healthy male volunteers, the mean (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC 0-72 =4.3 (1.2) mcg·hr/mL; C max =0.5 (0.2) mcg/mL; T max =2.2 (0.9) hours. Two azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to a single 500 mg tablet. In a two-way crossover study, 12 adult healthy volunteers (6 males, 6 females) received 1500 mg of azithromycin administered in single daily doses over either 5 days (two 250 mg tablets on day 1, followed by one 250 mg tablet on days 2 to 5) or 3 days (500 mg per day for days 1 to 3). Due to limited serum samples on day 2 (3-day regimen) and days 2 to 4 (5-day regimen), the serum concentration-time profile of each subject was fit to a 3-compartment model and the AUC 0-∞ for the fitted concentration profile was comparable between the 5-day and 3-day regimens. 3-Day Regimen 3-Day Regimen 5-Day Regimen 5-Day Regimen Pharmacokinetic Parameter [mean (SD)] Day 1 Day 3 Day 1 Day 3 C max (serum, mcg/mL) 0.44 (0.22) 0.54 (0.25) 0.43 (0.20) 0.24 (0.06) Serum AUC 0-∞ (mcg·hr/mL) 17.4 (6.2)* 17.4 (6.2)* 14.9 (3.1)* 14.9 (3.1)* Serum T 1/2 71.8 hr 71.8 hr 68.9 hr 68.9 hr * Total AUC for the entire 3-day and 5-day regimens. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of azithromycin 250 mg capsules is 38%. In a two-way crossover study in which 12 healthy subjects received a single 500 mg dose of azithromycin (two 250 mg tablets) with or without a high fat meal, food was shown to increase C max by 23% but had no effect on AUC. When azithromycin oral suspension was administered with food to 28 adult healthy male subjects, C max increased by 56% and AUC was unchanged. Distribution The serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the concentration range approximating human exposure, decreasing from 51% at 0.02 mcg/mL to 7% at 2 mcg/mL. The antibacterial activity of azithromycin is pH related and appears to be reduced with decreasing pH, However, the extensive distribution of drug to tissues may be relevant to clinical activity. Azithromycin has been shown to penetrate into human tissues, including skin, lung, tonsil, and cervix. Extensive tissue distribution was confirmed by examination of additional tissues and fluids (bone, ejaculum, prostate, ovary, uterus, salpinx, stomach, liver, and gallbladder). As there are no data from adequate and well-controlled studies of azithromycin treatment of infections in these additional body sites, the clinical significance of these tissue concentration data is unknown. Following a regimen of 500 mg on the first day and 250 mg daily for 4 days, very low concentrations were noted in cerebrospinal fluid (less than 0.01 mcg/mL) in the presence of noninflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro and in vivo studies to assess the metabolism of azithromycin have not been performed. Elimination Plasma concentrations of azithromycin following single 500 mg oral and IV doses declined in a polyphasic pattern resulting in a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and terminal elimination half-life of 68 hr. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly as unchanged drug, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Azithromycin pharmacokinetics was investigated in 42 adults (21 to 85 years of age) with varying degrees of renal impairment. Following the oral administration of a single 1 g dose of azithromycin (4 x 250 mg capsules), mean C max and AUC 0-120 increased by 5.1% and 4.2%, respectively, in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR 10 to 80 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (GFR >80 mL/min). The mean C max and AUC 0-120 increased 61% and 35%, respectively, in subjects with severe renal impairment (GFR <10 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (GFR >80 mL/min). Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in subjects with hepatic impairment has not been established. Male and Female Patients There are no significant differences in the disposition of azithromycin between male and female subjects. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic parameters in older volunteers (65 to 85 years old) were similar to those in young adults (18 to 40 years old) for the 5-day therapeutic regimen. Dosage adjustment does not appear to be necessary for older patients with normal renal and hepatic function receiving treatment with this dosage regimen. [see Geriatric Use (8.5) ] Pediatric Patients In two clinical studies, azithromycin for oral suspension was dosed at 10 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg on days 2 through 5 in two groups of pediatric patients (aged 1 to 5 years and 5 to 15 years, respectively). The mean pharmacokinetic parameters on day 5 were C max =0.216 mcg/mL, T max =1.9 hr, and AUC 0-24 =1.822 mcg·hr/mL for the 1 to 5-year-old group and were C max =0.383 mcg/mL, T max =2.4 hr, and AUC 0-24 =3.109 mcg·hr/mL for the 5 to 15-year-old group. In another study, 33 pediatric patients received doses of 12 mg/kg/day (maximum daily dose 500 mg) for 5 days, of whom 31 patients were evaluated for azithromycin pharmacokinetics following a low fat breakfast. In this study, azithromycin concentrations were determined over a 24 hr period following the last daily dose. Patients weighing above 41.7 kg received the maximum adult daily dose of 500 mg. Seventeen patients (weighing 41.7 kg or less) received a total dose of 60 mg/kg. The following table shows pharmacokinetic data in the subset of pediatric patients who received a total dose of 60 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic Parameter [mean (SD)] 5-Day Regimen (12 mg/kg for 5 days) N 17 C max (mcg/mL) 0.5 (0.4) T max (hr) 2.2 (0.8) AUC 0-24 (mcg⋅hr/mL) 3.9 (1.9) Single dose pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in pediatric patients given doses of 30 mg/kg have not been studied. [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with azithromycin and other drugs likely to be co-administered. The effects of co-administration of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs are shown in Table 1 and the effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin are shown in Table 2. Co-administration of azithromycin at therapeutic doses had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of the drugs listed in Table 1. No dosage adjustment of drugs listed in Table 1 is recommended when co-administered with azithromycin. Co-administration of azithromycin with efavirenz or fluconazole had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin. Nelfinavir significantly increased the C max and AUC of azithromycin. No dosage adjustment of azithromycin is recommended when administered with drugs listed in Table 2. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] * -90% Confidence interval not reported Table 1.

Resistance Azithromycin demonstrates cross resistance with erythromycin. The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is modification of the 23S rRNA target, most often by methylation. Ribosomal modifications can determine cross resistance to other macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLS B phenotype). Antimicrobial Activity Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections. [see Indications and Usage (1) ] Gram-Positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-Negative Bacteria Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other Bacteria Chlamydophila pneumoniae Chlamydia trachomatis Mycoplasma pneumoniae The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.
