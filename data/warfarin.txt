WARFARIN (Coumadin)

WHAT IT'S FOR:
Warfarin is a blood thinner (anticoagulant) used to prevent blood clots. It is prescribed for people with atrial fibrillation, artificial heart valves, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism. Warfarin works by blocking vitamin K, which is needed to make clotting factors.

COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:
- Easy bruising
- Minor bleeding (gums, nosebleeds)
- Longer bleeding time from cuts
- Hair loss (rare)

Regular blood tests (INR) are required to monitor warfarin levels and adjust dosing.

SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS:
- Major bleeding (internal bleeding, blood in urine or stool)
- Skin necrosis (rare)
- Purple toe syndrome
- Bleeding in the brain (stroke symptoms)

Seek immediate medical attention for signs of serious bleeding.

DRUG INTERACTIONS:
- Aspirin: significantly increases bleeding risk - avoid combining unless directed by doctor
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen): increase bleeding risk
- Vitamin K foods: large amounts of leafy greens can reduce warfarin effectiveness
- Many antibiotics: can increase or decrease warfarin effects
- Alcohol: increases bleeding risk and affects warfarin levels

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE IT:
- Pregnant women (causes birth defects)
- People with active bleeding
- People with recent surgery
- People with uncontrolled high blood pressure
- People with a history of falls or head injuries
