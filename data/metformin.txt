METFORMIN (Glucophage)

WHAT IT'S FOR:
Metformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It helps control blood sugar levels by decreasing glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. It is often the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes and can be used alone or with other diabetes medications.

COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Stomach pain
- Loss of appetite
- Metallic taste in mouth

These side effects are usually mild and often improve over time. Taking metformin with food can help reduce stomach-related side effects.

SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS:
- Lactic acidosis (rare but serious) - symptoms include muscle pain, weakness, trouble breathing, and unusual tiredness
- Vitamin B12 deficiency with long-term use

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of lactic acidosis.

DRUG INTERACTIONS:
- Alcohol: increases risk of lactic acidosis
- Contrast dye: stop metformin before imaging procedures
- Other diabetes medications: may increase hypoglycemia risk
- Certain blood pressure medications may affect how well metformin works

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE IT:
- People with kidney disease
- People with liver disease
- People who drink alcohol heavily
- People with heart failure
- People scheduled for surgery or imaging with contrast dye
