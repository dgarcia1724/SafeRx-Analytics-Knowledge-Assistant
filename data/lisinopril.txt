LISINOPRIL (Prinivil, Zestril)

WHAT IT'S FOR:
Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It works by relaxing blood vessels so blood can flow more easily. It is also used to treat heart failure and to improve survival after a heart attack. Lisinopril can help protect the kidneys in people with diabetes.

COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:
- Dry, persistent cough (very common with ACE inhibitors)
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Nausea

The dry cough is a known class effect of ACE inhibitors and may require switching to a different type of blood pressure medication.

SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS:
- Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat) - seek emergency help immediately
- High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
- Kidney problems
- Low blood pressure causing fainting

DRUG INTERACTIONS:
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen): reduce effectiveness and increase kidney risk
- Potassium supplements: may cause dangerously high potassium
- Lithium: lisinopril increases lithium levels
- Other blood pressure medications: may cause blood pressure to drop too low

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE IT:
- Pregnant women (can cause birth defects)
- People with history of angioedema
- People taking certain diabetes medications (sacubitril)
- People with bilateral renal artery stenosis
