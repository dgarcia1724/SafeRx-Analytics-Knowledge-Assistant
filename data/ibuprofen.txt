IBUPROFEN (Advil, Motrin)

WHAT IT'S FOR:
Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain, reduce fever, and decrease inflammation. It is commonly used for headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, menstrual cramps, and minor injuries. Ibuprofen works by blocking enzymes that produce prostaglandins.

- Stomach upset and heartburn
- Nausea
- Dizziness
- Headache

Taking ibuprofen with food or milk can help reduce stomach irritation.

- Stomach ulcers and bleeding (especially in elderly)
- Increased risk of heart attack and stroke with long-term use
- Kidney damage (especially with dehydration)
- Severe allergic reactions
- Liver problems (rare)

DRUG INTERACTIONS:
- Aspirin: ibuprofen may reduce aspirin's heart-protective effects
- Blood thinners (warfarin): increases bleeding risk
- ACE inhibitors and diuretics: ibuprofen reduces their effectiveness
