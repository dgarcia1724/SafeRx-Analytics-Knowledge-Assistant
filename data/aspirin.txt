ASPIRIN (Bayer, Bufferin)

WHAT IT'S FOR:
Aspirin is used to relieve pain, reduce fever, and decrease inflammation. Low-dose aspirin is also used to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people at high risk. It works by blocking prostaglandins (which cause pain and inflammation) and by preventing platelets from clumping together.

COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:
- Stomach upset and heartburn
- Nausea
- Stomach bleeding (with long-term use)
- Ringing in ears (tinnitus) at high doses

Taking aspirin with food or using enteric-coated tablets can help reduce stomach irritation.

SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS:
- Stomach ulcers and bleeding
- Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing)
- Reye's syndrome in children with viral infections
- Kidney problems with long-term high-dose use

DRUG INTERACTIONS:
- Warfarin and other blood thinners: significantly increases bleeding risk
- Ibuprofen: may reduce aspirin's heart-protective effects if taken together
- Methotrexate: aspirin increases methotrexate toxicity
- ACE inhibitors: aspirin may reduce their effectiveness
- Alcohol: increases risk of stomach bleeding

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE IT:
- Children and teenagers with viral infections (risk of Reye's syndrome)
- People with aspirin allergy or NSAID sensitivity
- People with active stomach ulcers
- People with bleeding disorders
- People scheduled for surgery (stop 7-10 days before)
- Pregnant women in third trimester
